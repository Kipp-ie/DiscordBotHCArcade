# NebulaBot - Open Source Java Discord Bot

NebulaBot is a feature rich, opensource java Discord Bot. Designed for server owners so that they can focus on other things instead of using bots that require subscriptions for basic features (Looking at you MEE6 >:|). You can change almost everything about NebulaBot by changing the included .env file.




## Features

- Moderation
- Welcome Messages
- Random Memes
- Private VC's
- Reaction Roles
- Suggestions
- Avatar tools
- Ticket System
- Random dog/cat pictures
  And more! If you want a full list of features you should try the bot yourself ;).


## Running on your own machine/server

By downloading and extracting the zip in releases you get a .jar and a .env file. You can't delete or move the .env file, that would break the bot.
Running the bot is pretty simple by using this command in your terminal (This can differ if you use other java versions).

```bash
  java -jar <jarname>.jar
```
